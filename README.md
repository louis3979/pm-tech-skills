# PM Skills: an AI Operating System for Head-of-Product work

> 57 skills and 29 chained workflows across 3 plugins for Claude Code and Claude Cowork. Tech-product requirements/delivery rigor, Head-of-Product leadership, and a markdown-native project memory system — focused on technology/IT products, not business-vertical domain knowledge.

Built from a Head-of-Product skill analysis: each skill encodes a concrete workflow (input → framework → output), not a generic prompt. Each command chains one or more skills into an end-to-end process.

## Start Here

Broad question, don't know where to start? → `/copilot`
Need strategic clarity? → `/set-strategy`
Writing a PRD? → `/write-prd`
Planning delivery (scope/schedule/risk)? → `/plan-delivery-risk`
Ready to release? → `/gate-release`
Worried you'll forget something important? → `/init-memory`, then `/ingest`
Need to pressure-test a decision from every angle? → `/party-mode` or `/sharpen`

## Plugins

<details>

<summary><strong>3. pm-memory</strong> — A markdown-native project memory system: durable knowledge, decisions, hypotheses, stakeholder tracking, and live claim verification that survives context loss between sessions (11 skills, 11 commands)</summary>

One operator, one product/initiative. `/init-memory` scaffolds a folder structure: raw artifacts land in `source/` (immutable), get synthesized into `ingestion/` (tagged observation/interpretation/hypothesis/assumption), and propagate into the durable layer — `knowledge/`, `hypotheses/` (evidence + confidence score), `decisions/` (audit trail + reversal condition), `stakeholders/` (touchpoints and cadence). A weekly `/review` sweep is what keeps it from rotting. Inspired by the second-brain model in [phuryn/pm-brain](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-brain); `memory-verify-claim` applies a lesson from [upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) (fetch live current sources instead of answering time-sensitive questions from stale training-data recall) — both rebuilt in this marketplace's own conventions, not copied.

**Skills (11):**

- `memory-init` — Scaffold the memory folder structure into the current directory; detects greenfield/migration/active-repo, runs a short interview, commits locally (never pushes)
- `memory-ingest` — The workhorse: classify a raw artifact, copy it to `source/`, tag observations in `ingestion/`, propagate to the durable layer as warranted
- `memory-prep` — Read-only pre-meeting brief for a stakeholder or topic: last touchpoint, open asks, suggested questions
- `memory-review` — Weekly maintenance sweep: stale knowledge, stale evidence, hypothesis hygiene, stakeholder cadence, knowledge compression, archival
- `memory-decide` — Formalize a decision with a full evidence trail and reversal condition, drafted `pending` until the operator confirms it
- `memory-hypothesize` — Draft or update a tracked belief with evidence, confidence score, and a decision trigger
- `memory-risk-scan` — Five-area risk scan for a feature/initiative, drafting hypothesis stubs for uncovered areas
- `memory-ideate` — Grounded solution directions for a problem area, tagged with the evidence behind each
- `memory-plan` — Six-block plan for an objective: known, assumed, who to talk to, hypotheses to open, experiments, decision points
- `memory-strategy-check` — Check a proposal against stated strategy, citing the specific clause
- `memory-verify-claim` — Check a specific time-sensitive claim against live current sources instead of relying on training-data recall

**Commands (11):**

- `/init-memory` — Initialize the project memory system in the current directory
- `/ingest` — Ingest a raw artifact into project memory
- `/prep` — Pre-meeting/pre-task brief for a stakeholder or topic
- `/review` — Run the weekly maintenance sweep
- `/decide` — Formalize a decision with an evidence trail
- `/hypothesize` — Draft or update a tracked hypothesis
- `/risk-scan` — Five-area risk scan for a feature/initiative
- `/ideate` — Grounded solution directions for a problem area
- `/plan` — Six-block plan for an objective
- `/strategy-check` — Check a proposal against stated strategy
- `/verify-claim` — Check a specific time-sensitive claim against live current sources

## Installation

### Claude Cowork (recommended for non-developers)

1. Open **Customize** (bottom-left)
2. Go to **Plugins** → **Personal** → **+**
3. Select **Add marketplace from GitHub**
4. Enter: `louis3979/pm-tech-skills`
5. Click **Sync**

Both plugins install automatically. You get both commands (`/copilot`, `/gate-release`, etc.) and skills.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add louis3979/pm-tech-skills

# Step 2: Install individual plugins
claude plugin install pm-tech-product@pm-tech-skills
claude plugin install pm-leadership@pm-tech-skills
claude plugin install pm-memory@pm-tech-skills
```

### Other AI assistants (skills only)

The `skills/*/SKILL.md` files follow the standard skill format and work with any tool that reads it. Commands (`/slash-commands`) are Claude-specific.

```bash
# Example: copy all skills for OpenCode (project-level)
for plugin in pm-*/; do
  mkdir -p .opencode/skills/
  cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* .opencode/skills/ 2>/dev/null
done
```

## How It Works

**Skills** give Claude domain knowledge and a guided workflow for a specific task. They load automatically when relevant to the conversation, or can be force-loaded with `/plugin-name:skill-name`.

**Commands** are user-triggered workflows invoked with `/command-name`. Each chains one or more skills in the same plugin into an end-to-end process, and ends by suggesting relevant next commands.

**Plugins** group related skills and commands into an installable package.
